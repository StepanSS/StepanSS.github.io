<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Liz Swann Miller.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm a Naturopath and a best-selling Amazon author who has helped over 14,793 women and men</strong> reclaim their health, fitness, and happiness with the advice they needed to improve their physical well-being.</p>
<p>As a professional weight-loss expert, <strong>I was ashamed and frustrated by the weight I'd gained</strong> after a difficult and complicated pregnancy. No matter which of my time-tested techniques I tried, <strong>I just couldn't get rid of pounds and pounds of stubborn excess fat!</strong></p>
<p>I was disappointed, ashamed, and more alone than I'd ever been. I felt absolutely helpless.</p>
<p><strong>That all changed when I took a plane to Africa and discovered the delicious tea that made me burn body fat quickly and easily, <em>without feeling hungry.</em></strong></p>
<p class="mb-5"><span class="rtd-pink">Now, you need to read this article until the very end, because I'm actually going to give you this revolutionary ancient tea recipe today.</span></p>

<p>I then went on to <span class="text-primary">cleanse away</span> an incredible <span class="text-primary"><b>27 more pounds.</b></span></p>
<p><strong>That's <span class="text-primary"><b>41 pounds</b></span> all gone because of one cup of tea.</strong></p>
<p class="mb-4">It was all thanks to a <span class="text-primary">bizarre legend my South African college exchange student had told me about when I was younger,</span> a tale about a delicious red tea discovered in the remote African wilderness, and the Kenyan tribe who drank it to stop <strong>all the feelings of hunger.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-10 m-auto rtd-creambg rtd-border-left py-4 px-5">
<p class="rtd-30px">The legend said:</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.2rem;">An African Shaman possessed an ancient recipe for a delicious red tea so powerful that whoever drank it gained unlimited energy - with no thirst and no hunger.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-10 m-auto pt-4">
<p>It sounded crazy, and yet I was absolutely dying to find out the truth. <strong>Could drinking this red tea really make someone never feel hungry?</strong></p>
<p>You can't buy this tea blend in the store because it's still mostly a secret. In fact, I'm literally the first person in America who's ever brought it back from Africa, and if I hadn't gotten out of that jungle alive, you wouldn't be hearing about it today.</p>
<p>But don't worry, because you can actually find all the ingredients you need at any grocery store. You might even have them in your house right now. And the tea works like magic. You feel full, satisfied, and energized almost instantly, and <b>your body will actually activate its natural ability to burn fat</b>, a built-in superpower you might not have used in years.</p>
<p>Additionally, <span class="rtd-pink"><b>absolutely anyone can use it!</b></span> Regardless of your age, gender, or health.</p>
<h3 class="text-center rtd-dark">You can drink this tea to detox your body</h3>
<h2 class="text-center rtd-pink">and shed 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 pounds or more,</h2>
<h3 class="text-center rtd-dark">just like I did.</h3>
<p>I can't even begin to describe the feeling of complete and utter relief as those first few pounds disappeared. When they kept coming off, I knew I'd found something special. </p>
<p class="text-center">In a matter of mere weeks, <span class="text-primary"><b>I dropped 41 pounds.</b></span></p>
<p class="rtd-30px text-center">That's right - <strong><u>41!</u></strong></p>
<p class="text-center rtd-30px">No more diet failures. <span class="rtd-pink">No more guilt</span> or remorse.</p>
<p>With each pound I lost, I was one step closer to being happier, one step closer to my old self. <strong>I was back in my skinny jeans again.</strong></p>
<p>You can actually see me smiling-more slender than I've been in years - right in this picture from last Sunday at a family barbecue.</p>

<p>You see, my last pregnancy took a toll on me. After multiple complications, I was put on extended bed rest. I spent 80% of my day stuck in bed, and I was forced to give up the active lifestyle I loved so much.</p>
<p>I became sluggish. I felt exhausted all the time. Eventually, I developed a sweet tooth, and I absolutely lost control of my weight.</p>
<p>I felt like a fraud. Here I was helping people all over the country lose weight and get the bodies they wanted while I was lying in bed looking worse than I ever had.</p>
<p><b>Honestly, I felt disgusted with myself</b>, and even though my husband was very supportive, telling me he didn't care what I looked like, <b>I knew deep down he just wasn't physically attracted to me anymore.</b> I just wasn't the same person he had fallen in love with.</p>
<p>Finally, I knew it was time for a change and I decided to face the music. I reluctantly stepped onto the scale and, to my disgust, <b>I saw that I'd gained 41 pounds.</b></p>
<p>I couldn't believe it. I knew my weight had gotten out of hand but I had no idea it had gone <strong>this</strong> far. I couldn't face the world. I went back to bed and spent the rest of the day crying my eyes out.</p>

<p>If you've ever gained a lot of extra weight or felt like your body was simply out of control, <strong>I know how helpless and hopeless you feel.</strong> Thankfully, I know there's a solution that works because <strong>I've done it.</strong> Plus, it's fast, easy, and it tastes delicious.</p>
<p><b>Best of all, <span class="rtd-pink">I lost</span> every one of those stubborn <span class="rtd-pink">41 pounds</span>...for good!</b></p>
<p>So, you can understand why I was willing to fly to Africa and go deep into the jungle to find this mysterious recipe!</p>

<p>The unique combination of special ingredients in this tea literally unlocks your fat cells to help remove built-up toxins and reset your body's metabolism - and these are the two factors that are making it impossible for you to lose weight.</p>

<p>This new rule is about reducing your <span class="text-primary">chronically high stress levels,</span> a critical part of losing weight.</p>
<p>Follow my advice and <strong>you will feel less stressed</strong> and <strong>release more body fat.</strong> </p>
<p class="text-center rtd-24px"><strong>It's true. Your stress is holding your body back.</strong></p>
<p>Very few people truly understand how <span class="text-primary"><em>chronically high stress</em></span> levels <span class="text-primary">do serious harm</span> to maintaining proper levels of fat-burning and fat-storing hormones which are required for <span class="text-primary"><em>releasing</em></span> and <span class="text-primary"><em>burning excess fat.</em></span></p>
<p>Not only that, but you'll find out about how this <span class="rtd-pink">red tea</span> recipe, found deep in the heart of Africa, not only reduces stress, it also stimulates your body's natural systems to work together and <strong>burn more fat, in less time.</strong></p>

<p>Did you know that most of the processed food on grocery store shelves contains <b>harmful substances?</b></p>
<p><strong>The common food toxins found in processed foods include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nitrates in processed luncheon meats</li>
<li>Omega-6 fatty acids in oils from cottonseed, corn, soybean, safflower, and others</li>
<li>Processed sugar and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) commonly found in soda</li>
<li>GMOs or Genetically modified foods</li>
<li>Residues from pharmaceuticals, manufacturing chemicals, and other toxins in meat, eggs, and dairy</li>
<li>Pesticides and herbicides in conventionally grown produce and grain</li>
</ul>
<p>When combined, all these <b>toxic factors</b> can result in low levels of <span class="rtd-pink">fat-burning hormones</span> and high levels of <span class="rtd-pink"><b>fat-storing hormones</b></span> in the body, and this dreaded combination can sabotage your fat loss efforts and ruin your chances at having the slender body you want.</p>
<p class="text-center rtd-24px">It's not just <strong><i>how much</i></strong> you eat, it's <strong><i>what</i></strong> you eat.</p>
<img class="float-md-left d-block m-auto mr-md-3 pb-3 img-fluid" src="assets/pesticides.png">
<hr class="rtd-hr w-50 m-auto">
<p>One of the reasons your body holds onto fat is because it <strong>uses that fat as a "safe" storage facility for <span class="rtd-pink">toxic compounds</span> like pesticides and mercury.</strong></p>
<p>That's why you should seriously consider detoxing your body.</p>
<p>Research by Skidmore College exercise scientist Paul Arciero showed that <strong>detoxification can even reduce oxidative stress</strong> which has been linked to causing diseases like ALZHEIMER'S.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p><span class="rtd-pink">Even our own bodies can produce toxins without us even knowing.</span> If all these sources of toxins aren't properly taken care of, the build-up can cause critical hormone imbalances which may lead to <span class="rtd-pink">serious health issues</span> and weight gain, and could end in <span class="rtd-pink"><b>obesity.</b></span></p>

<p>Due to cutting-edge research, we now know that the hormone <span class="rtd-pink"><b>'Noradrenaline'</b></span> may hold the key to <span class="rtd-pink"><b>unlocking fat cells and shrinking them</b></span> - it's what <i>causes</i> the action of the incredible shrinking fat cell.</p>
<p><b>Noradrenaline</b> is a <span class="rtd-pink">stimulant hormone</span> that signals your body to <b>start using your belly fat for energy.</b></p>
<p>The takeaway here? <b>The more Noradrenaline produced in the body, the more pounds the body naturally sheds.</b></p>
<p class="font-weight-bold">This <span class="rtd-pink">red tea</span> just so happens to <span class="rtd-pink">boost Noradrenaline production!</span></p>

<p>Scientists have made astonishing discoveries, and a recent breakthrough is something scientists call the exercise <b>"sweet spot."</b></p>
<p>Your sweet spot is the exercise intensity level where <span class="rtd-pink"><b>the full fat-burning power of your body is unleashed</b></span> so your body draws on fat stores for fuel. </p>
<p class="text-center rtd-24px">You are not exercising <strong>harder.</strong> You are exercising <strong>smarter.</strong></p>
<p>Do this right, and fat layers under your skin vanish and excess pounds disappear. You can drop a dress or a pant size in two weeks as <b>your whole body becomes firmer, sexier and trimmer.</b></p>
<p>Sadly, most people are <span class="rtd-pink"><b>eating too little</b></span> and <span class="rtd-pink"><b>exercising too much,</b></span> and this actually works <strong>against</strong> fat loss.</p>
<p>You'll see how <strong>this red tea can literally <span class="rtd-pink">force your fat cells to open</span> and <span class="rtd-pink">detox your body</span></strong> to quickly cleanse away all those extra pounds and inches.</p>
<h4 class="text-center rtd-lite mb-3">Sounds amazing, doesn't it?</h4>
<p>I don't even care how stubborn that belly fat has been, if you've always wanted to <span class="rtd-pink">fit into clothing</span> you've only dreamed about before, I'll show you how you can rebalance your fat loss hormones and unblock crucial metabolic fat-burning steps so you can <span class="rtd-pink"><strong>control your fat-burning</strong></span> and <span class="rtd-pink"><strong>fat-storing hormones</strong></span> and do it as easy as 1, 2, 3.</p>

<p>What was so incredible was that, not only did I find this African Shaman's <strong><span class="rtd-pink">"no-hunger"</span> red tea recipe, this tea has the most remarkable fat-cleansing action I've discovered in 15 years of traveling the world as a Medical Maverick.</strong></p>

<p>When I tried exercising to exhaustion to burn more belly fat, it had little effect on my fat loss.</p>
<p><strong>I went to my doctor to find out why <span class="rtd-pink"><u>I couldn't lose the weight.</u></span></strong></p>

<p>My husband and I weren't anywhere close to being as intimate as we used to be, and I knew that deep down it was <strong>my own fault.</strong></p>
<p>I was pushing him away because I was ashamed of my body - because I felt like <strong>I was becoming a different person.</strong></p>
<p>Deep inside me, I knew <b>he just wasn't attracted to me anymore.</b></p>
<p>Each time I weighed myself, the numbers were up, even as I ate less and less and exercised more and more.</p>
<p>As you might have already guessed, I had a few other nagging symptoms that made me feel sick, like:</p>
<img class="float-left mr-md-5 mb-3 img-fluid feel-sick" src="assets/feel-sick.jpg">
<ul>
<li class="mb-3">waking up feeling tired even after sleeping 8 hours</li>

<li class="mb-3">difficulty concentrating</li>

<h4 class="text-center rtd-architect">She said, "I'm sorry, but I can't give you the recipe. Only the village Shaman can do that. <span class="text-danger">Only he has the power to entrust you with the ancient recipe."</span></h4>
<p>In order to get to this Shaman, the path was once again going to be treacherous. We had to walk for fifteen miles and climb an even steeper trail for <em>several hundred feet.</em> There, at the top of the highest cliff, is where I could find the village Shaman.</p>
<p>What's worse, since the trail moved outside the cover of the trees and into the simmering sun, Rose told us that the only way we'd ever survive the trek was by travelling in the cool of the night. </p>
<p>After experiencing the <span class="rtd-pink">incredible effects of this magical tea</span> <strong>firsthand,</strong> I knew I wasn't leaving this continent without it.</p>
<p><strong>Still, I was afraid.</strong> Fifteen miles is a long, long way, especially in the pitch dark with only a few torches for light. </p>
<p class="text-center rtd-24px">What could I do? Give up? I don't think so.</p>
<p>After several hours and about twelve miles of steady hiking, I was getting tired. The humid air, the enveloping darkness, and the exhaustion from the difficult path caught up with me and, after a misstep, I stumbled.</p>
<p><span class="rtd-pink"><strong>I fell sideways into a wet sandy hole.</strong></span> After struggling to get up and failing, the panic set in. I was sinking, and I was sinking fast.</p>
<p>Then the guide emerged from the trees again, holding a large bundle of sticks. He placed them in front of me across the top of the sand in a path leading out of the deadly trap.</p>
<p class="text-center rtd-24px font-weight-bold">"Now," the guide urged. "Push yourself out! It is the only way!"</p>
<p>I pushed down on the path ahead of me with all of my strength. I strained, I screamed, and I labored with all of my being. Once I emerged from that deadly pit, the guide grabbed me by the arm and dragged me out to safety.</p>
<p>My legs were shaking. I was exhausted. After my second brush with death, I was terrified. <em>Is it really worth risking my life for this recipe?</em></p>
<p>That's when we took a break. The villagers poured us some of the red tea while we rested.</p>
<p>It tasted delicious. It <span class="rtd-pink">stopped my hunger</span> and <span class="rtd-pink">gave me the energy</span> to keep going, even after hiking for miles and facing almost certain death.</p>

<p>We immediately bowed in a sign of respect.</p>
<p>It was then that Rose told the Shaman why I was here and what I had come for. </p>

<p>So I told the Shaman about <b>what I'd been through</b>, the countless miles I'd travelled, the gruelling trek to the village, the attack from the deadly viper, and the quicksand. Rose tried to keep up with the translation and matched my enthusiasm with her own.</p>
<p><span class="rtd-pink"><b>Suddenly, the Shaman laughed.</b></span> It was a surprisingly joyful laugh. He motioned for me to come closer.</p>
<p>He placed the ancient bowl in my hands with the dried red leaves in it, called out into the void over the cliff, and traced some kind of symbol over my head.</p>
<img class="float-left mr-4 mb-3 img-fluid" src="assets/tea-recipe.jpg">

<p>That's when Rose took me to a special tea-making hut. There she showed me how to make this delicious red tea.</p>
<p class="font-weight-bold">The <span class="rtd-pink">recipe was simple</span> and easy to make. A batch of it lasted all day.</p>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-10 m-auto">
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold">Question: Why a red tea? Isn't green and black tea as good as red tea?</p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">Answer: No. Black tea is actually burnt green tea and black tea is full of caffeine just like regular green tea. Even if you drink decaffeinated green or black tea, the decaffeination process <span class="rtd-pink">destroys</span> much of the natural ingredients. So, it makes more sense to <span class="rtd-pink">drink a red tea that naturally contains no caffeine but still gives you energy.</span></p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Does red tea really stop hunger?</p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">Answer: The red tea's 5 herbal ingredients work in harmony to end cravings and make you feel full to <span class="rtd-pink">stop your hunger.</span> That's why the native villagers call it the <span class="rtd-pink">"no-hunger drink."</span></p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Why is this red detox drink so special?</p>
<p>Answer: It's the <span class="rtd-pink"><b>perfect health drink</b>.</span> It's refreshing and tasty, hot or iced. It helps clear toxins, it reduces fat-storing hormones, and it promotes the production of <b>fat-burning</b> hormones while <span class="rtd-pink">naturally reducing stress and balancing insulin.</span></p>
<p>I'm a naturopath, and I've spent years studying the <span class="rtd-pink">benefits and side effects</span> of each of the <span class="rtd-pink">five unique ingredients</span> that go into your red tea. Along with the powerful African red tea recipe, my detox plan is <span class="rtd-pink">carefully formulated</span> according to the latest <span class="rtd-pink">holistic health</span> and <span class="rtd-pink">scientific research</span> to maximize your fat loss during the 14 days of the detox. </p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">The recipe contains these 5 powerful ingredients to create the ultimate <span class="rtd-pink"><b>metabolism-boosting, fat-busting, energy-revitalizing drink</b></span> that's not found in green or black teas.</p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Is it vegan and vegetarian?</p>
<p>Answer: <span class="rtd-pink">It is caffeine free, vegan and vegetarian safe, dairy free, gluten free and sugar free.</span><sup>7, 8</sup> It's a <span class="rtd-pink">great alternative</span> to caffeine with absolutely no jitters, so cleansing fat away is safe and rapid. This red tea contains no fats or carbohydrates. The flavor is mild and slightly sweet.</p>
<p>The tea is packed full of <span class="rtd-pink">powerful antioxidants</span> that fight oxidative damage caused by toxins in your body, 10 of which have been scientifically proven to have antibacterial, anti-parasitic, and antiviral action to boost your immunity.</p>
<p>So, drinking this delicious red detox tea does more than just <span class="rtd-pink">halt hunger.</span> It also helps you:</p>

</ul>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: What powerful antioxidants are found in these five unique ingredients?</p>
<p>Answer: Quercetin may help protect the body from free radical damage. Luteolin can <span class="rtd-pink"><strong>kill cancer cells</strong></span> and <span class="rtd-pink">prevent tumor growth.</span><sup>7, 8</sup> It also contains a high-density lipoprotein (HCL) for <span class="rtd-pink"><strong>good cholesterol.</strong></span><sup>10</sup></p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">It may also have beneficial effects on blood pressure by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to aid in protecting the heart.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Are the ingredients for The Red Tea Detox easy to find?</p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">Answer: Yes. You can easily <span class="rtd-pink">find them in your local supermarket and health food stores.</span> You can also buy them online. They won't cost you much at all.</p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Do I need to be a good cook or have a lot of time to cook?</p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">Answer: No. You should be able to make the <span class="rtd-pink">delicious red detox tea and smoothies</span> in just a few minutes. Every recommended meal is carefully designed for real people living real lives, with easy instructions.</p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Why does this program cost so much less than other programs?</p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">Answer: I'm so confident in the effectiveness of this program and the miraculous red tea recipe that inspired it, that I know it's going to be a huge success. Plus, I know what it's like to feel helpless when it comes to your weight, so I want to help as many people as I possibly can. Since I don't want the price to stop you from getting the body you want, I'm making it as <span class="rtd-pink"><strong>affordable</strong></span> as I possibly can.</p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Can I do this detox even if I'm older or have health issues such as heart disease or diabetes?</p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">Answer: Yes! If you have a medical condition or physical condition, please talk to your doctor before starting this program. However, this is not a starvation or deprivation detox, and all the ingredients are <span class="rtd-pink">safe, nourishing, natural superfoods.</span></p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: How many payments do you charge me?</p>
<p class="rtd-answerBorder pb-5">Answer: Only <span class="rtd-pink"><strong>one payment of just $37.</strong></span></p>
<p class="rtd-18px font-weight-bold pt-3">Question: Is my purchase guaranteed?</p>

Results May Vary: the weight loss results testimonials are in no way a guarantee of results. Individual weight loss results, including amount and time, will vary. Whether genetic or environmental, it should be noted that food intake, rates of metabolism and levels of exercise and physical exertion vary from person to person. This means weight loss results will also vary from person to person. No individual result should be seen as typical.
