	    		But before I get started, let me properly introduce myself.<br><br>
	    		Hi, I am Sebastian.<br><br>
	    		If you know me, you know how obsessed women are with having sex with me, how they tell their friends about the multiple hair-raising orgasms and kinky sex acts they thought they’d never do, especially with a stranger.<br><br>
	    		How they feel immediate trust in me when we hit the bed and how they’ll do anything to please me back, because I finally made them feel like a real woman…<br><br>
	    		…and if you know me VERY well, you know I used to be completely useless in bed.<br><br>
	    		If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s when the quality of sex isn’t enough for your girl, it’s literally relationship suicide.<br><br>
	    	</div>
	    	<div class="headline" style="color:black!important">
    			Here’s the truth… and this is pretty much where my story begins…
    		</div>
    		<br>
    		<div class="text">
	    		7 years ago, before I knew the truth to pleasing women sexually, my (now) ex-girlfriend Michelle used to cry from frustration every time we had sex. Although she loved me, she just couldn’t get over the fact that I didn’t match her super-horny needs as a woman.<br><br>
	    		In the beginning she only cried quietly and secretively in the bathroom. She was torn between her love for me and her instinctual lust for intense, dominating sex that made her orgasm.<br><br>
	    		But eventually Michelle started sobbing in bed straight after having sex… every single time.<br><br>
	    		It was so awkward and embarrassing, I couldn’t think of anything to say other than <i>“I am sorry”…</i><br><br>
	    		I was so scared of her cheating on me because of the bad sex, I’d heard of it happening a lot and even to a few friends of mine. But we loved each other so much and our relationship was perfect in every other area. I was convinced that bad sex couldn’t ruin all that.<br><br>
	    		But I was totally naive and eventually I learned a bitter lesson:<br><br>
	    	</div>
	    	<div class="headline" style="text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px #000000">
	    		“A bad sex life is like a ticking bomb – it WILL destroy everything unless you defuse and stop it!”
	    	</div>
	    	<br>
	    	<div class="text">
	    		The hardest part is you don’t know when this bomb will explode. Could be the next time you have sex, or in 2 years just when you think everything's going perfectly and that she’s the one. But believe me – it eventually will.<br><br>
	    		I remember it like yesterday. It was Sunday evening and we were at my apartment when I experienced the thing no guy ever wants to happen.<br><br>
	    		It was just after sex which ended with me cumming too quickly as usual, and her not climaxing at all – as usual, when she just couldn’t take it any longer.<br><br>
	    		After crying at the end of the bed for 5 minutes, she turned round, not even able to look me in the eyes, and said <i>“I love you Seb, but it’s just not enough.”</i> I will spare you the emotional details.<br><br>
	    		Michelle ended our relationship when the door closed, hoping to find another man as quickly as possible who would fill that sexual void and take her frustration away.<br><br>
	    		The thought of her having sweaty, breathless, orgasmic sex with another guy made me sick.<br><br>
	    		I was crushed, but soon after I realized the huge amount of FRUSTRATION and SUFFERING I had caused her with my lame sex techniques… that she deserved better. <br><br>
	    		But when that door closed I could hardly breath, my whole body was trembling and I couldn’t speak a word because I was so blindsided and broken.<br><br>
	    		After my girlfriend left me due to our lousy sex life, I was shit-scared to approach new women on the street or at work. I was so anxious because I knew I couldn’t deliver the kind of hair-raising sex women need and want.<br><br>
	    		Even though you know you won’t get intimate with every woman you meet, this deep-rooted anxiety seems to seep into every part of your daily life and cripples your ability to be confident and respected as a man. I realized my essence was scared and damaged.<br><br>
	    		That is the moment I swore to myself that I would NEVER EVER disappoint a woman in bed again.<br><br>
	    		In the next 6 six months I learned more about female orgasms than even the heaviest sex addicts would dream about.<br><br>
	    		Fueled by humiliation, I absorbed every sex manual, every video and scientific study about sex and orgasms - written by scientists and psychologists, not some clueless freelancer in Men’s Health or Cosmo. It wasn’t so much curiosity but a necessity; a fundamental need to restore my self-confidence. <br><br>
	    		After hundreds of hours of research, I not only found out WHY I was lousy in bed and exactly how I could make women lay trembling in ecstasy, but I also learned everything about the woman’s body. Much more than most girls know about themselves.<br><br>
	    		After half a year of painstaking studies, I knew more about sex and the female body than 99% of people - both men AND women.<br><br>
	    		How did I figure that out? Well, even though it was one of the toughest things I’ve ever done, I started having sex with women again.<br><br>
    		</div>
    		<div class="headline" style="text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px #000000">
	    		And this is where things get really exciting…
	    	</div>
	    	<br>
	    	<div class="text">
	    		After all this deep studying, women were so overwhelmed, so shocked with my new techniques even after the 1st night we met, they said nobody had ever been able to make them feel like a sex goddess willing to do anything to please me any way I wanted.<br><br>
	    		They felt connected, sexy and excited to do things they swore they would never do.<br><br>
	    		For them it seemed like they finally found a guy who understood and knew exactly what made them tick, like in those popular sex fantasy novels women read.<br><br>
	    		This is when I realized how much women LOVE having sex, many times even more than guys – but only when it’s mind-blowing, orgasmic sex like I’m about to teach you. <br><br>
	    		If you can do this for them they will never want to let you go, and then the ball is in your court to play the game as you please. <br><br>

	    	<div class="text">
	    		For me, everything just seemed to fall into place once I mastered sex. The more hot and sexy women I had sex with, the more orgasm techniques I developed!<br><br>
	    		It’s like the reward for having great sex with hot women was the ability to give hot women even greater sex…déjà vu – I guess.<br><br>
	    		And then my day-to-day life improved. My anxiety was gone and I became a dominant, respected man by both men and women.<br><br>
	    		That’s when I realized it wasn’t truly my fault that I sucked in bed before. The real problem was that magazines and other sources give completely wrong information about what THEY THINK women really want. <br><br>
	    		Reading article like: “5 tips for a better sex life” will not turn you into a sex god who women do anything for… I call BULLSHIT!<br><br>
	    		It’s also NOT your fault that you don’t know exactly how you can get a woman to orgasm this intensely and predictably – because you’ve been lied to your whole life about what great sex is or even looks like.<br><br>
	    	</div>
	    	<div class="headline" style="color:black!important">
    			It’s actually the total opposite…
    		</div>
    		<br>
    		<div class="text">
    			Online blogs and articles will never reveal the REALLY good tips and tricks – these orgasm techniques are so powerful that the 1/10 of a percent of men who know them don’t want you to figure it out. That would mean more competition for them, so they tell you to do the opposite. <br><br>
    			Think about it: how often have you read step-by-step, proven tips regarding intense anal sex and skin-tingling squirting? Probably never. <br><br>
    			The truth is, literally EVERY woman can experience a squirt orgasm and 65% of women love anal sex. But these magazines and blogs make these things seem dirty and unwanted, when in fact women crave them. I’ll show you exactly how to get them to do these things sooner than later.<br><br>
    			And that’s only two examples…<br><br>
    			I’m about to show you EIGHT.<br><br>
    			As soon as you say goodbye to those lie-riddled mainstream articles along with their vanilla missionary style sex and learn the real orgasm methods, your sex life will transform so fast you won’t know what to do with all the women calling you back for more. <br><br>
    			Just like what happened to me starting 6 years ago… but it won’t take you nearly as much time…<br><br>
    			…it won’t even take you a week. <br><br>
    			Here’s a crazy story. I only truly realized that women were addicted to having sex with me when I was added by an unbelievably cute girl on Facebook. <br><br>
    			After a little bit of small talk, this girl finally cracks and tells me she’s a friend of my CURRENT sex partner, and that her friend had gushed about me and my techniques so much that she now wanted to meet me too.<br><br>
    			…My sex techniques were so incredible that women were literally sending their friends to me! <br><br>
    			Sentences like: <i>“You know my pussy better than I do!”</i> and <i>“Can we do it again tomorrow?”</i> became a daily occurrence for me.<br><br>
    			…I used to think you only heard women say stuff like that in porn. But that’s far from true. <br><br>
    		</div>
    		<div class="header-box">
	    		<div class="headline" style="font-size: 34px!important; text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px #000000">
	    			Eventually, this new reputation began circling around and all my guy friends were desperate to know what I had learned. I was constantly bombarded with questions such as:
	    		</div>
	    	</div>
    		<div class="lightbluebox-ebook">
    			<div class="contentblue">
				    <div class="red-arrow-list">
				    	<ul style="margin-left:-20px">
				    		<li>"How do I get my girlfriend to squirt?”</li><br>
				    		<li>“How do I convince my girlfriend to have anal sex with me?”</li><br>
				    		<li>“How can I get my partner to orgasm in a way she has never done before?”</li><br>
				    		<li>“How do I get my wife to give me a blowjob without having to ask for one?”</li><br>
				    		<li>“How do I get more spice into our sex life?”</li><br>
				    		<li>“How do I guarantee my girlfriend stays with me and doesn’t cheat?”</li>
				    	</ul>
				    </div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<br>
			<div class="text">
				Words like “convince” and “cheating” were totally foreign to me at this point. With my techniques these words didn’t even exist. <br><br>
				But because I was so interested whether my methods would work for other men too, I started giving them step-by-step explanations for my techniques to use on their women. <br><br>
				It didn’t take long before my friend David came running in to tell me all about how this girl he picked up last night won’t stop calling him for more earth-shattering sex…<br><br>
				<i>“Seb, what the hell is happening? She dirty talked, orgasmed 4 times, squirted and we even done anal on our first time… where did you get this stuff??”</i><br><br>
				Another example was when my friend Chris’s wife started giving him blowjobs all the time without him asking – she even starting waking him up with blowjobs a few times a week.<br><br>
				Even my most inexperienced friend had brought his longtime girlfriend to 3 different, all new, orgasms. He now says they have more sex than he can handle – sometimes up to three times a day! <br><br>
				These aren’t just effective at enhancing relationships either, they’re SAVING them… <br><br>
				A friend, who doesn’t want to be named, even stopped his girlfriend leaving him for another guy. She had been so frustrated and unsatisfied with their sex life before, but now she is stuck to him like glue. <br><br>
				When I saw how these exact orgasm methods helped my friends and so many other naive guys, and how happy they and their partners had become with their sex life, I decided to say “screw you” to all the false gurus and crappy articles out there the biggest way I knew how…<br><br>
				…by helping as many men as I possibly could.<br><br>
				So, are you ready to know the FULL 8 orgasm formulas that allowed me to sleep with and captivate hundreds of smoking-hot women over the last 6 years? <br><br>

    			Every subtle hand motion and technique, the exact angles, trigger points and timing of movements, all of these are crucial in order to get your girl to gasp and claw at the bedsheets, begging for more. <br><br>
    			So where can you learn the exact steps to triggering any of these points the right way to induce mind-blowing orgasms, let alone several in a single night? <br><br>
    			That’s what I had to learn the hard way, so you DON’T. <br><br>
    			What if there was a way you could learn all of this in-depth information in a format that included easy, step-by-step walkthroughs to perfect your technique, before you even have to touch a girl? <br><br>
    			Videos that would take you through LIVE demonstrations using anatomical models, so you can see EXACTLY what you need to do to your girl, as well as loaded presentations explaining why it’s so powerful and how to do each variation in-depth. <br><br>
    			This kind of sex-insider information has never existed in this format before, but that’s about to change…<br><br>
    			I’ve condensed ALL my sexual expertise, every single trick and hack I learned over the last 6 years and loaded it into a 10-module video course designed to teach you these exact skills, step-by-step, as effectively as possible using LIVE demonstrations.<br><br>

    					<li>To bring a woman to such bone-shaking intense orgasms that none of her ex-partners were able give her, to ensure she’ll never look at other guys again?</li><br>
    					<li>To finally let your partner have the BEST sex of her life? To stop this ticking time bomb and save your relationship or masculine ego from lousy sex and embarrassment?</li><br>
    					<li>To not be worried about embarrassing yourself when having sex with a new woman for the first time – but to know she’ll be addicted to you and your dynamite sexual ability?</li><br>
    					<li>To hear your girl say she’s scared to lose you because she knows no other man will satisfy her sexually the way you can?</li><br>
    					<li>To know she’s telling her girlfriends all about how great you are and knowing they all stare at you with lust, wishing they were your girl?</li>

    			</div>
    			How much is that worth to you?<br><br>
    			$500?; $1000?; maybe even $2000??<br><br>
    			My friends like David and Chris who’ve used these very techniques told me it would be a complete sin to let this go for under $1000… but you won’t pay that.<br><br>
    			For me, I would have easily paid a few grand 7 years ago to save my relationship; to save my girlfriend who I loved and to not disappoint her any longer.<br><br>
    			Because this complete orgasm course has such a huge amount of powerful techniques with life-changing consequences, I initially wanted to sell 8-FO for a more than reasonable price of $297. <br><br>
    			But I know you might not be able to justify that expense, no matter how much you want this solution, and since my goal is to help as many men like you as possible, you won’t pay anything remotely near $297…<br><br>
    			And let me clear the air: this is not a monthly subscription or contract to anybody. Simply pay once and you get full access to 8-FO for life!<br><br>
    			So if it’s not $297, how much is it?<br><br>

	    		That’s right. For the price of only a single month’s gym membership you can become an absolute rockstar in bed for the rest of your life, commanding orgasms as you please, getting the hottest girls fighting for you to make them cum non-stop AND earning automatic respect from your fellow men.<br><br>
	    		If that’s not a no-brainer I don’t know what is. <br><br>
	    		And here’s where this offer becomes an absolute steal…<br><br>
	    		In order to prove to you how confident I am that this course will transform your life, I’m throwing in a complete 60-day money-back guarantee.<br><br>
	    		<center>
	    			<img src="images/guarantee_8.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 586px"><br><br>
	    		</center>
	    		That means you can get “8-FO”, watch every single minute, learn and use all my secrets, and if you STILL feel it wasn’t worth your money simply email me and I’ll refund you every last penny ASAP, no questions asked. <br><br>
	    		You literally cannot lose by taking this offer. <br><br>
	    		But here’s the catch…<br><br>
	    		I want to help as many GOOD guys as possible. I can’t let these techniques land in the wrong hands since a lot of guys are jerks and will use this course to manipulate women and mess with their emotions.<br><br>
	    		I love women, and if you’ve joined me this far then I’m assuming you do too. That’s why I’m only opening this course to the first 500 buyers. After that, the doors will close and your chance to get all this breakthrough material will disappear along with your chance to give women blood-pumping orgasms on demand. <br><br>
	    		I am not the guy to pull gimmicks and false statements. The sole reason why I am limiting this course is simple; I want to ensure that all my members who write me an email will get the support and attention they deserve. My response time is usually just few hours, often a lot quicker. If I had thousands of clients, I wouldn’t be able to give you this guarantee and support. Easy as that.<br><br>
	    		With that said, I’ve set an automatic closure for this site at exactly 500 purchases. After that you’ll see a text telling you “Sold out – you are too late.” I don’t even need to press a button to trigger that.<br><br>
	    		Do you want to wait for that to happen? You’ve already watched this far, that tells me you want in as soon as possible. <br><br>
	    		If you order “8-FO” right now, the following will happen: You will have IMMEDIATE access to the entire 10-module program for you to dive in and absorb. <br><br>
	    		You don’t need to wait a few days for a packet or DVD which someone else could find in the mail. I promise you that you will NOT receive anything via mail from me. This course is fully online and accessible from any device connected to the internet.<br><br>
	    		Discretion is also applied on your PayPal or credit card statement, since you will not see the name of this product or any sexual word. NOBODY will ever find out that you have purchased this course. <br><br>
	    		Now’s the time to act. Don’t hesitate – it won’t take long until all 500 have been sold, they’re already flying off the shelf as we speak and other guys are well on their way to mastering female orgasms like I have. Just click on the “Purchase” button below.<br><br>
	    		Imagine if you had all this proven orgasm knowledge 6-12 months ago, how would your relationships, even your entire life be different? <br><br>
	    		Even if you were only to use THREE of these unknown methods, you will be able to get your girlfriend or hook-up to have such incredible orgasms that she’ll beg you to do unbelievable things to her.<br><br>
	    		If you’re picturing all these possibilities in your imagination, now’s the time to make them a reality.<br><br>
	    		Click on the “Purchase” button below and secure your limited copy of “8-FO” <mark>for only $67</mark>, before all 500 spots are taken.<br><br>
	    		Like I said, this is NOT a subscription, but a mere one-off payment. You will not have to pay another cent again, regardless of how much of a sex god you become. <br><br>

    				The full course consists of 10 modules. Each module goes about 7 to 45 minutes.  I tried to condense it down to only include the most important aspects – making it easy to follow. Each female orgasm module includes demonstration clip in which I show you in detail how the technique is to be performed. This is not illustrated on a real vagina or breasts but rather on a life-like prop.

    				Nothing will be visible in regards to your purchase. Your account statement (or PayPal account) will be completely inconspicuous. Nothing will suggest a sex course purchase and you won’t receive anything by mail. You’ll simply receive your receipt via email. There is no middle man; nothing is delivered; it’s just between you and me.
